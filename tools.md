## PENETRATION TESTING
Penetration testing is an essential part of securing any network, and this a report that gives a highlight of the various applications of some of the tools which is crucial for identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities. 

This project report will show the process of creating backdoors, port scanning, and transferring files securely. There will also be an introduction of Netcat basics, network fundamentals, network troubleshooting, advanced techniques(black hat tricks), and how to exploit vulnerabilities.
