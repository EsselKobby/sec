# PASSWORD LOCKER

### PROJECT DESCRIPTION

###### PYTHON-BASED PASSWORD MANAGER

This is a project based on my personal problem and challenge of having accounts on many different websites. I know it is a bad habit to 
use the same password for each of them because if any of those sites has 
a security breach, the hackers will learn the password to all of your other 
accounts. It’s best to use password manager software on your computer that 
uses one master password to unlock the password manager. Then you can 
copy any account password to the clipboard and paste it into the website’s 
Password field.

###### CAUTION
This project is not secured but I will continue to apply and build on it so as to make it more secure for users.The project offers a basic demonstration of how this program work.
